==============

Some exercises done for the microprocessors course. 

This code was intended for intel's 8086 microprocessor. An emulator can also be used to run compile and link the code,
I recommend [emu8086](http://www.emu8086.com/).

This program takes a string from the console and checks how many integer number substring it has and adds them together.
