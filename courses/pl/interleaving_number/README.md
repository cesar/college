Word Frequency and Interleaving Lists
===================

Part of my Programming Languages course, our assignment consisted of two problems

- Create a method that checks for the frequency of words in a piece of text and print out the list of all the words ordering them descending (most frequent - least frequent) 
- Creat a method that finds all the interleavings of two lists of numbers

Implementation of these two problems was done using Python 2.7.3. Note this is my first time using Python, my experience was extremely pleasant.
